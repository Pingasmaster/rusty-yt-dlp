# rusty-yt-dlp
A rust 1:1 rewrite of the whole yt-dlp project to be fast and safe. Every C and python part of the code has been rewritten in rust or replaced with a crate.

This project is a test to see if an agentic AI framework can rewrite large swaths of code, debug, and maintain a rust fork of an existing software. This was entirely done by AI with minimal human input, please do not submit PRs and do not file issues unless you can provide a good PR that resolves it. I will not maintain this, so do not use this in production.
